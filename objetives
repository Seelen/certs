Understand and use essential tools
  Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax
  
  
  Use input-output redirection (>, >>, |, 2>, etc.)
  
    1	 pgm >    file Output of pgm is redirected to file
    2  pgm <    file Program pgm reads its input from file
    3  pgm >>   file Output of pgm is appended to file
    4	 n >      file Output from stream with descriptor n redirected to file
    5	 n >>     file Output from stream with descriptor n appended to file
    6  n >& m   Merges output from stream n with stream m
    7  n <& m   Merges input from stream n with stream m
    8  << tag   Standard input comes from here through next tag at the start of line
    9	  |       Takes output from one program, or process, and sends it to another
  
  Use grep and regular expressions to analyze text

  Access remote systems using SSH
    
    # ssh user@domain
    
  Log in and switch users in multiuser targets
  
    # runlevel
    # systemctl list-units -t target -a
    # systemctl enable graphical.target --force    
    
  Archive, compress, unpack, and uncompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2

  Create and edit text files
  
    #touch file
    #vim/nano file
  
  Create, delete, copy, and move files and directories
    
    # rm -f file
    # cp file /to/directory/
    # mv file /to/directory/
    
    # mkdir directory
    # rm -rf directory
    # cp -rf directory
